For my final project i am planning on creating a jumping game where you jump between platforms. 
The game will be a verticle based game so you will be jumping up to reach a finish platform. 
I plan on adding obsticles that move between these platforms and once collided with, cause the game to end.

This project took a while due to me having to reserch a bunch of extra stuff for the game. for example,
implementing gravity.
other things include, making my charecter stay on platforms instead of sliding off.
level transitions.
implementing charecters, backrounds, and death and win screens, with png, jpg, and jfif.
the hitboxes are also a little funky due to me having the charecter as small.
I also implemented speed variation between levels 1, 2, and 3.
With that being said, I hope you enjoy my game!
